### Events

The ``||loops:on start||`` block is an **event block**.  An event block runs its code when a certain event occurs.

For the ``||loops:on start||`` block, pressing the Play button is the event that triggers this event block.

The shape of an **event block** allows other code blocks to fit inside it.

### Statements

The ``||agent:move||`` block is a **statement block**.  A statement block performs an action.

Drag a ``||agent:move||`` block from the ``||agent:AGENT||`` category into the ``||loops:on start||``.
